# Indians-Diabetes-Prediction-using-Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-
This project presents a machine learning solution for the binary classification of diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The goal is to accurately predict whether a patient is diabetic (Outcome: 1) or non-diabetic (Outcome: 0) based on health indicators such as Glucose levels, BMI, and Age.
